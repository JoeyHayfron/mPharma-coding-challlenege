This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setting up the project

* In order to setup this project, download a zip file from the repository or copy the link and clone the repository in any directory of choice.
* Once this is done open the unzipped directory or the cloned directory in the terminal and run npm install to install the needed libraries.
* After installation, the project is ready to be run. Just type npm run start in the terminal at the same directory and this should start the app.
* If your browser does not launch the app automatically, a link will be provided in the terminal once the app is running. That link can be copied and pasted in the browser.
